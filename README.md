This is a simple POC which I built to learn video stream related topics.

Frontend: React
Backend: Express
Upload: multer
Video Processing: FFmPeg


You can Upload video which will then display in the playlist.
You can also select and play that video which will be adaptive streaming that means only a chunk of video will be download upon needed.
